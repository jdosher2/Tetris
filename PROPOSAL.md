For the final project, I am going to make a Tetris game. It will be an implementation of the standard Tetris game including...
 * a game board with different colored pieces
 * ability to move/rotate pieces and increase their falling speeds
 * preview of next piece *(potentially a stretch goal)*
 * leveling system with increasing difficulty
 * scoring system with saved high scores
 * background music and sound effects
 * pause menu, clean way to exit/restart game
 * in-game timer to show how much time has progressed since starting *(potentially a stretch goal)*


 To get started, I can look over the of-snake game to better understand how to set up and use the graphical interface.
 I will use the ofSoundPlayer and ofGraphics libraries to create this project.
